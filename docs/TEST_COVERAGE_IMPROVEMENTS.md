## Coverage Targets

| Component | Target | Tests Added |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| API Endpoints | 80%+ | 100+ cases |
| Services | 80%+ | 55+ cases |
| Repositories | 80%+ | 20+ cases |
| Models/Schemas | 90%+ | 25+ cases |

## New Fixtures Added (tests/conftest.py)

- `test_organization` - Creates test organization for integration tests
- `test_department` - Creates test department with organization
- `test_team` - Creates test team with department
- `test_user` - Creates test user for integration tests
- `authenticated_client` - Authenticated test client
- `db_session` - Alias for db_session_integration

## Test Organization

### Integration Tests
Focus on end-to-end API behavior:
- HTTP request/response validation
- Authentication/authorization
- Database persistence
- Error responses

### Unit Tests
Focus on isolated component behavior:
- Business logic validation
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- Data validation

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=productivity_tracker --cov-report=html

# Integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Specific module
pytest tests/integration/test_organization_endpoints.py -v
```

## Coverage Improvement Strategy

1. ✅ **Added missing entity tests** - Organizations, Departments, Teams
2. ✅ **Created service layer tests** - Business logic coverage
3. ✅ **Added repository tests** - Data access layer coverage
4. ✅ **Model validation tests** - Pydantic schema validation
5. ✅ **Integration tests** - End-to-end API testing
6. ✅ **Added necessary fixtures** - Test data setup

## Next Steps for Maintaining 80%+ Coverage

When adding new features:

1. **Add integration tests** for new API endpoints
2. **Add unit tests** for new services/repositories
3. **Add model tests** for new Pydantic schemas
4. **Update fixtures** as needed for test data
5. **Run coverage report** before merging

## Coverage Report Command

```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=productivity_tracker --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# View coverage in browser
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
start htmlcov/index.html  # Windows
```

## Test Quality Checklist

- [x] Tests cover happy paths
- [x] Tests cover error cases
- [x] Tests cover edge cases
- [x] Tests are isolated (no dependencies between tests)
- [x] Tests use proper fixtures
- [x] Tests have descriptive names
- [x] Tests are organized by functionality
- [x] Tests validate responses thoroughly

## Estimated Coverage Increase
