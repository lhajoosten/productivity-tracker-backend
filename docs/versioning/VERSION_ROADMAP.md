# Version Roadmap

This document outlines the planned evolution of the Productivity Tracker API following semantic versioning principles as defined in [VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md](VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md).

## Version Philosophy

Each version builds upon the previous, following a logical progression from core functionality to enterprise-grade features. We prioritize:
- **Stability**: No breaking changes within major versions
- **Security**: Continuous security improvements across all versions
- **Usability**: Progressive enhancement of developer and user experience
- **Scale**: Gradual introduction of performance and scalability features
- **Quality**: Increasing test coverage and code quality standards
